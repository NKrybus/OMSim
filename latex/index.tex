{\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_o_m_sim}{OMSim}}}} is a Geant4 framework for the simulation of optical modules of the Ice\+Cube Observatory. It has been mostly developed by the MÃ¼nster Ice\+Cube Group during different master and PhD theses. The project is separated into different modules depending on the study (e.\+g. background investigations with radioactive decays, or sensitivity studies). These modules share common files (in the \char`\"{}common\char`\"{} folder) which, for example, define geometries from modules and PMTs or also material properties.

Please check the different Modules in the \href{https://icecube.github.io/OMSim/}{\texttt{ documentation}} for further details and examples.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsubsection{Installing Geant4}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
First you should install Geant4 following \href{https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/installguide.html}{\texttt{ the guide provided by cern}}. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_o_m_sim}{OMSim}} is currently optimised for Geant4-\/11.\+1.\+1. If you want to use the visualisation tools of Geant, you should include the following cmake options\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{-\/DGEANT4\_INSTALL\_DATA=ON -\/DGEANT4\_USE\_GDML=ON -\/DGEANT4\_USE\_OPENGL\_X11=ON -\/DGEANT4\_USE\_QT=ON -\/DGEANT4\_USE\_RAYTRACER\_X11=ON -\/DGEANT4\_USE\_XM=ON}

\end{DoxyCode}
 \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{Requirements}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
There are a few dependencies. You can install them using the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{apt-\/get -\/y install libxerces-\/c-\/dev libxmu-\/dev libxpm-\/dev libglu1-\/mesa-\/dev qtbase5-\/dev libmotif-\/dev libargtable2-\/0 libboost-\/all-\/dev libqt53dextras5}

\end{DoxyCode}
 If you needed to install more, add a comment it in the Git project, so we can complete the above command ðŸ˜Š

Also you will need ROOT. Download the last binary (e.\+g. at time of writing latest version is 6.\+28/04 \href{https://root.cern/releases/release-62804/}{\texttt{ https\+://root.\+cern/releases/release-\/62804/}}), or compile the source distribution. For simplicity add the source in your .bashrc (or you will have to source it yourself manually every time you run or compile \mbox{\hyperlink{class_o_m_sim}{OMSim}})\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{export ROOTSYS= YOUR\_ROOT\_PATH}
\DoxyCodeLine{source \$ROOTSYS/bin/thisroot.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{Compiling OMSim}\label{index_autotoc_md4}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Clone this branch.
\item Check {\itshape CMake\+Lists.\+txt} and change the paths with the Geant4 bins and libraries of your system
\item Make a new folder named e.\+g. \char`\"{}build\char`\"{}
\item From the build folder run cmake as follows 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/D4Geant4\_DIR=YOUR\_G4\_INSTALL/lib/Geant4-\/11.1.1/ ..}

\end{DoxyCode}
 where \char`\"{}\+YOUR\+\_\+\+G4\+\_\+\+INSTALL\char`\"{} is the path to the install folder of Geant4 in your system.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
If you have to compile the project several times you should add an alias in your bashrc, e.\+g. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{alias mycmake="{}cmake -\/D4Geant4\_DIR=YOUR\_G4\_INSTALL/lib/Geant4-\/11.1.1/"{}}

\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyNote}
-\/Source the Geant4 library (you could add this to your .bashrc) 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{source YOUR\_G4\_INSTALL/bin/geant4.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Finally, just run {\ttfamily make} or {\ttfamily make -\/j N} where N is number of cores you want to use for the compilation.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Available studies}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
\mbox{\hyperlink{class_o_m_sim}{OMSim}} has been utilized in a range of studies, each simulating unique physics, thereby necessitating distinct Physicslist/analysis setups. In this repository, we have compiled a selection of these studies, each contained within its own folder and accompanied by its own main file. Currently available\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://icecube.github.io/OMSim/group___effective_area.html}{\texttt{ Effective area}}\+: calculates the effective area of the optical modules/\+PMTs.
\item \href{https://icecube.github.io/OMSim/group__radioactive.html}{\texttt{ Radioactive decays}}\+: simulates radioactive decays within the glass of the pressure vessel and the PMT glass. Essential for understanding the primary background of optical modules.
\item \href{https://icecube.github.io/OMSim/group__sngroup.html}{\texttt{ Supernova studies}}\+: used for the development of an improved SN trigger for Ice\+Cube using multi-\/\+PMT modules.
\item \href{https://icecube.github.io/OMSim/group__bubble.html}{\texttt{ Bubble column}}\+: used for investigating the capability of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classm_d_o_m}{m\+DOM}} flashers in determining bubble column parameters.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Most users will likely utilize just one of these studies, meaning there\textquotesingle{}s no need to compile all of them. If you wish to exclude certain studies from compilation, you can comment out the undesired ones in the CMake\+Lists.\+txt between lines 41-\/43 (where the {\bfseries{add\+\_\+subdirectory}} commands are located).
