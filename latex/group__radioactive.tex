Simulations for understanding the background produced by radioactive decays in borosilicate glass of optical modules \& PMTs.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
This study has been tested only for Vitrovex glass (m\+DOM/\+LOM16) and the 80mm \mbox{\hyperlink{classm_d_o_m}{m\+DOM}} PMTs. Okamoto glass (D-\/\+Egg/\+LOM18) is currently under investigation.
\end{DoxyWarning}
The simulation considers the measured scintillation parameters and the specific activity of the isotopes to provide insights into the behavior of OMs in both air and ice environments over a time window \$t\+\_\+\{w\}\$. The primary output is a timestamped list of detected photons, which can be utilized to compute parameters such as the module\textquotesingle{}s expected dark rate. The simulation steps can be summarized as\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Determining the number of decays within $t_{w}$ based on measured data.
\item Initiating decay chains for each event by positioning an isotope randomly in the pressure vessel.
\item Assigning decay times from a uniform distribution within \mbox{[}0, $t_{w}$\mbox{]}, in case the time difference between mother-\/daughter decay times surpasses $t_{w}$.
\item Capturing photons detected by the PMTs for downstream analysis.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Important customizations in the simulation involve the extension of Geant4\textquotesingle{}s original scintillation class, facilitating the simulation of more complex decay processes (8 lifetimes), and the modification the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_g4_radioactive_decay}{G4\+Radioactive\+Decay}} class which amends default decay time of isotopes. The scintillation properties of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classm_d_o_m}{m\+DOM}} glass were measured in the scope of several theses.
